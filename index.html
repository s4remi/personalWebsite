Hi! I am currently a student in the Khoury College of Computer Science at Northeastern University, San Francisco campus. I am hoping to graduate in 2024. 
Prior to this, I earned my B.Eng in civil Engineering and AS in Mathematics.
I am highly interested in most areas of computer science, with a particular interest
 in computer graphics such as AR,VR, Visualization. I have experience working on various projects related to
  game engines such as Unity3D, Unreal Engine, and Cocos2dx. Additionally, I have a solid understanding
  of OpenGL, WebGL, Vulkan, and Metal. I hope to maintain my passion for computer graphics and pursue
relevant job opportunities in the future.

In addition to computer graphics, I am also interested in backend development technologies such as distributed systems and networking.
I enjoy and am proficient in using languages such as C/C++, Objective-C, Python, Java, Javascript/Typescript, Swift, and Rust.
 My favorite programming language is Rust!
Previously, I have worked in various positions related to artificial intelligence, natural language processing, game and graphics development, and front-end development at Microsoft, Tencent Games, Taichi Graphics, Apple, and Google. I am honored to begin a new chapter in my career as an AR/VR Software Engineer at Apple starting in June of this year.
I am eager to learn and grow in my career.
